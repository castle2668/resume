# Sean Huang（黃永翔）

4 years in web development, from startups to big corporations.
Not just focused on React, Vue, and Next.js. I have a solid understanding of web browsers, JavaScript, and the ability to adapt to any web application.
As a frontend engineer, the web is still a thriving ecosystem and I want to contribute to the world more alongside talented people.
